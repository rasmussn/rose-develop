    "Parses and disassembles an executable to obtain a global control flow graph (CFG).  The CFG is constructed such that each "
    "vertex represents an instruction rather than a basic block in order to simplify this demo, but a production analysis would "
    "probably use basic blocks since that would be more efficient.  This demo then runs the executable with the specified "
    "command-line arguments to obtain an execution trace and the trace is immediately mapped onto the CFG.  Finally, the demo "
    "prints some interesting information about the trace:"

    "@numbered{A list of instructions in the CFG that were never executed. This is a simple code-coverage.}"

    "@numbered{A list of executed instructions that do not appear in the CFG.  This is the inverse idea of the previous "
    "bullet and indicates where ROSE's static analysis failed to find executable instructions.}"

    "@numbered{A list of instructions that have multiple successors in the CFG but only one successor in the trace. These "
    "are branches that were never taken or always taken.}"

    "@numbered{A list of instructions having multiple trace successors, sorted by decreasing burstiness.  These represent "
    "branches where hints controlling speculative execution might improve performance.}";
